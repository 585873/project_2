How I created my first rails app

    1. Planned ERD diagram which contained two models: Instructors and Students with few attributes
    2. Created new repo for project 2
    3. Created actual rails app using command line
    4. Rails app contains:
      - Two models: instructors and students
      - Added controllers
      - views
      - Migrate files
      - seed file
      - updates routes.rb file
      - updated css stylesheet
      - updated layouts
    5. After step 4 I had rails app working in the browser
    6. Added new functionalites such as "devise" which allowed to create "sign in", "sign out", "sign up" forms for new users.
    7. Deployed my app to heroku
